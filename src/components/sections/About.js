                I am a full stack web developer with a good eye. I've always had a love for design and user experience. In my 8 years of teaching, this applied to how I operated my classroom. In web development, I've found that this applies to UX but also the code itself and how its structured and written.

                After graduating with a degree in education from the University of Texas at Austin and teaching little people, I bring leadership and effective communication skills to this world of web development. I am well versed in teamwork and being detail-oriented. I strive daily to make life easier for people - whether that be clients, my students, my family, or my dog.
